    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this document is to outline the functional requirements for a simple full-stack application based on Flask and SQLite. This application will manage user data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting user information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Scope\n",
    "This document details the functionalities required for the application, which will be used to manage a list of users. The application will provide a web interface for performing CRUD operations on user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 User Management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Create User\n",
    "- **Description**: The system shall allow the admin to add a new user to the database.\n",
    "- **Inputs**: User name, email, and age.\n",
    "- **Process**: The admin enters the user details into a form and submits it. The system validates the input and inserts the new user into the database.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: A confirmation message indicating the user has been added successfully, and the updated list of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Read Users\n",
    "- **Description**: The system shall display a list of all users stored in the database.\n",
    "- **Inputs**: None.\n",
    "- **Process**: The system retrieves all user records from the database and displays them on the home page.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: A list of users with their details (ID, name, email, age).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 Update User\n",
    "- **Description**: The system shall allow the admin to update the details of an existing user.\n",
    "- **Inputs**: User ID, new name, new email, and new age.\n",
    "- **Process**: The admin selects a user to update, enters the new details, and submits the form. The system validates the input and updates the user record in the database.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: A confirmation message indicating the user has been updated successfully, and the updated list of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.4 Delete User\n",
    "- **Description**: The system shall allow the admin to delete a user from the database.\n",
    "- **Inputs**: User ID.\n",
    "- **Process**: The admin selects a user to delete and confirms the action. The system deletes the user record from the database.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: A confirmation message indicating the user has been deleted successfully, and the updated list of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Performance Requirements\n",
    "- The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Security Requirements\n",
    "- The system should validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Usability Requirements\n",
    "- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. External Interface Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 User Interfaces\n",
    "- The home page shall display a list of users.\n",
    "- The update page shall provide a form to update user information.\n",
    "- The delete functionality shall be accessible via a button next to each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces\n",
    "- The application shall run on standard server hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Software Interfaces\n",
    "- The application shall interact with the SQLite database using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Communications Interfaces\n",
